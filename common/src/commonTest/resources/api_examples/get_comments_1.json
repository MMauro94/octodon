So let's indulge our inner tech geeks and dive into the details of this issue, and explore how we, as a self-hosting community, can contribute to the solution.\n\nThe crux of the upheaval is a policy change from Reddit that's putting the existence of beloved third-party apps, like Reddit is Fun, Narwhal, and BaconReader, in jeopardy. Reddit has begun charging exorbitant fees for API usage, so much so that Apollo is facing a monthly charge of $1.7 million. The ramifications of these charges have resulted in an outcry from the Reddit community, leading to a number of subreddits planning to go dark in protest.\n\nThese actions have pushed many users to seek out alternative platforms, such as Lemmy, to continue their digital explorations. The migration to Lemmy is especially significant for us self-hosters. Third-party applications have long been a critical part of our Reddit experience, offering unique features and user experiences not available on the official app.\n\nAs members of the Selfhosted group on Lemmy, we're not just bystanders in this shift - we have the knowledge, skills, and power to contribute to the solution. One of the ways we can contribute is by assisting with the archiving efforts currently being organized by r/datahoarder on Reddit. As self-hosting enthusiasts, we understand the value of data preservation and have the technical acumen required to ensure the wealth of information on Reddit is not lost due to these policy changes.\n\nSo, while we navigate this new territory on Lemmy, let's continue to engage in productive discussions, share insights, and help to shape the future of online communities. Your decision to join Lemmy's Selfhosted group signifies a commitment to maintain the spirit of a free and open internet, a cause that is dear to all of us.\n\nFinally, in line with the spirit of the original Reddit post, if you wish to spend money, consider supporting open-source projects or charities that promote a free and accessible internet.\n\nWith that, let's roll up our digital sleeves and embark on this new journey together.

It's taken until now for me to work things out.\n\n>For the time being, Relay is going to be free for everyone to use (this means no fees and no ads) while i continue optimising API calls and finalising subscription prices. I'm working hard to get call volumes down and i'll try my best to hit as low a price point as possible, at least for a base tier that covers 85-90% of users. At the higher end of usage it's looking like i'll need to implement a few different price points but this is still something i need to figure out. I'll let you know when i do.\n\n>Thanks again for all the incredible messages over the last week. I've seen them all and they really mean a lot - knowing how long some people have been using Relay for is amazing. For anyone moving on from here, thanks for supporting Relay over the last 12 years - i'm forever grateful.\n\n>Relay Pro (should now be free to use): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=reddit.news\n\n>Relay video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2sTb4GzEz4\n\n>Cheers, Dave","creator_id":722538,"community_id":14762,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-30T21:29:53.948379","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"embed_title":"Update: Relay will continue to operate from July 1st.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., another presidential contender, called the loan forgiveness plan an ‚Äúillegal and immoral‚Äù bid to ‚Äútransfer student debt to taxpayers.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you take out a loan, you pay it back,‚Äù Scott said in a statement.\n\nBiden‚Äôs debt-forgiveness effort would have canceled up to $20,000 in student loans for millions of individual borrowers, at an estimated cost of $400 billion.\n\nPayments on those loans, which had been paused for more than three years by both the Trump and Biden administrations, are set to resume in October.\n\nThe 6-3 ruling, which split the conservative-majority court along ideological lines, sawed off a major plank of Biden‚Äôs sweeping agenda to provide relief for Americans impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obviously a blow to the administration,‚Äù Katharine Meyer, a education policy expert and fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview Friday.\n\nMeyer noted, however, that she doesn‚Äôt expect the ruling will mark an end to the efforts to forgive student loan debt.\n\nBiden is set to deliver an address Friday afternoon. ‚ÄúThis fight isn‚Äôt over,‚Äù his official Twitter account vowed.\n\nPence and others in the GOP, including the Republican National Committee, condemned the president‚Äôs plan as a subsidy for wealthy college graduates, a category that tends to lean Democratic.\n\nBut most borrowers don‚Äôt fit into that group: One-third of them owe less than $10,000, and another 20% owe between $10,000 and $20,000, according to data last year from The Washington Post.\n\n‚ÄúThe vast majority of borrowers are those that have taken out fairly small loans, and a large share of them never earned a college degree,‚Äù Meyer said. ‚ÄúA lot of the individuals who would have benefited in some way from this policy are lower-income Americans.‚Äù\n\nOther Republicans have put forward alternative plans for addressing the country‚Äôs burgeoning student loan debt.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the main GOP primary rival to Trump, has proposed putting universities on the hook when their students default on their debt. Earlier this month, a group of Senate Republicans put forward a package of bills aimed to address ‚Äúskyrocketing‚Äù higher education costs.\n\nCanceling student debt is a popular idea: Polls have shown that most registered voters support at least some form of loan forgiveness.\n\nAs of 1 p.m. ET on Friday, neither Trump nor DeSantis had weighed in on the ruling.\n\n[source](https://losangelesweeklytimes.com/2023/06/30/republicans-celebrate-after-supreme-court-scraps-biden-student-loan-relief-program/)","creator_id":794102,"community_id":16140,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-30T19:03:54.004045","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"thumbnail_url":"https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/c26dc9cc-c247-4b30-acd1-7818e6c1552b.jpeg","ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/post/863002","local":false,"language_id":0,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":16140,"name":"usa","title":"United States | News & Politics","removed":false,"published":"2020-08-25T01:32:17.844462","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"actor_id":"https://lemmy.ml/c/usa","local":true,"hidden":false,"posting_restricted_to_mods":false,"instance_id":394},"counts":{"id":938205,"comment_id":1062334,"score":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"published":"2023-06-30T21:37:59.984456","child_count":0,"hot_rank":1716},"creator_banned_from_community":false,"subscribed":"NotSubscribed","saved":false,"creator_blocked":false},{"comment":{"id":1062265,"creator_id":42112,"post_id":1640613,"content":"I'm getting the same bug.

Meanwhile, Lemmy devs are mostly unpaid since it's an open source project, and most instance owners are losing money on server costs in order to host a space for people to enjoy. \n\nHey, if any YouTube channels see this and you end up making Lemmy content videos, instead of offering lip service on how much you support creators or this platform or anything, maybe take some of your Lemmy content revenue and donate it to the development fund or to the instance where you got the content from, thanks.

With Lemmy, I can reason about how the JS client works and do my best, but working with Lemmy you sometimes have to consume the Rust source as well.\n\nSo, this raises the barrier of entry for someone wanting to do Lemmy integrations to someone that needs to consume the above docs, plus be comfortable reading JS and Rust.\n\nI saw some older posts from the lemmy devs saying: \"Well, writing docs is hard, so it's easier if we generate the docs from our JS client.\"\n\nThey aren't wrong, writing documentation IS hard. If Lemmy is serious about attracting a larger ecosystem, I consider better API documentation to be on the hot path. I'm concerned that the devs are happy with the autogenerated docs above and won't put any effort into improving them. Even worse, the people generating these docs are already familiar with Lemmy, so they probably think the current docs are adequate.\n\nI don't know a quick solution -- raise money to pay someone to write docs? No clue.

Linus Torvalds himself once said (albeit 10 years ago) that the shares he received from Red Hat before their IPO was 'his only big Linux payout'.  I don't think anyone would disagree with the statement that Red Hat has had a major significant positive impact on Open Source across the world.\n\nThis morning I listened to an excellent podcast called \"Ask Noah\" where he interviewed Red Hat's Mike McGrath who has been active on the linux subreddit and other social media.  It seems that Mike has been involved in the decision to restrict Red Hat's sources on git.centos.org:\n\n        https://podcast.asknoahshow.com/343 (listen at ~20 mins)\n\nIt's really worth a listen.  Mike clearly lays out the work that Red Hat (I was surprised to find out that it is NOT the Rebuilders) does to debrand the Red Hat sources, why they're pulling that back on those unbranded sources, and that they understand the ramifications of doing so.  It's also interesting that Mike is of the opinion that there is nothing wrong with doing a Rebuild, and he defends them by stating \"that's the cost of doing business\".  Noah and Mike go into many of the nuances of the decision and again, it's really worth listening to.  Mike also talks about \"bad faith\" when dealing with the Rebuilders at 40:30, which I think explains Red Hat's decision.  I got the distinct feeling he's bound by some ethical code so he won't/can't say too much though.\n\nThere's also this discussion about Rocky Linux securing a contract with NASA:\n\n        https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36417968\n\nthat had a lot of internal discussion at my company this week, which given what's just happened may shed some more light on Red Hat's decision.\n\n-----\n\nThere are always two sides to every story but in this case there are three sides to this story.\n\nOn one side, you have Red Hat, a long time champion of open source software, that has poured billions of dollars into open source development, and which has 1000s of employees who not only on 'company' time but in their own time manage, develop, contribute, and create open source code.  They have funded countless successful and unsuccessful projects that we all use.\n\nAgainst Red Hat are two largely distinct groups.  The first is the Rebuilders themselves, who Red Hat has claimed 'don't offer anything of value back to the community'.  This is not meant to be a statement on the usefulness of the rebuilds (Rocky, Alma, Oracle, etc.) but rather a very directed statement on whether or not the rebuilders are providing bug report, feedback, and contributions to the packages that Red Hat has included in RHEL.\n\nThe second group, which stands somewhat behind the Rebuilders, are the Rebuild users.  One could argue that the users are caught in the middle of Red Hat and the Rebuilders, however, I think it is better to look at them as being an equal 'side' in this discussion.\n\nThe Rebuild users are in a very unfortunate position: they're about to lose access to a free product that they've come to depend on.  They are, as expected, unhappy about Red Hat's decision to stop providing access to RHEL sources.  My next statement is callous, and I expect it to be read as such: You get what you paid for.  That is not meant to indicate anyone is cheap, it's just that you shouldn't have expectations when you are using something for free.\n\nHere's the interesting part for me.  As far as I can see, none of the users are jumping to the Rebuilder's defence of Red Hat's accusation that the Rebuilders provide nothing back to the community.  And, as far as I can tell across various social media and news platforms' comments sections, largely the user community AGREES with Red Hat's position.  Informed users -- not all users -- are using a RHEL Rebuild knowing that there is no benefit in doing so for the community.\n\nI have yet to read a reply from the Rebuilders where they categorically deny that this is the case.  And to me, that's glaring and damning of the Rebuilders' position.  Even the 'defenders' (for lack of a better word) of the Rebuilders have yet to provide a response.\n","creator_id":1156780,"community_id":14701,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-30T15:06:02.800655","updated":"2023-06-30T15:11:28.468169","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"ap_id":"https://reddthat.com/post/232729","local":false,"language_id":0,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":14701,"name":"linux","title":"Linux","description":"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nLinux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991 by Linus Torvalds.
