We managed to significantly improve the situation - lemmy.world content is now reaching lemm.ee with a very high success rate - but this has had the effect of increasing incoming federation traffic on our servers significantly.\n\nAdditionally, we have been seeing steadily increasing normal user traffic over the past week, which is awesome from a community standpoint, but of course means that our servers have to do more work to keep up with all the new people.\n\nTo top things off, today there appeared a badly configured instance in the network, which was effectively launching a DoS attack against lemm.ee for several hours. Most likely it was unintentional, but unfortunately the end result was a severe increase in our server load.\n\n**All these factors combined resulted in a really bad experience for most lemm.ee users today.** Page load times have consistently been spiking into as much as 10 seconds or more for the whole day:\n\n![](https://lemm.ee/pictrs/image/ddd85f1d-7646-47b0-a9f4-1ab1a8dd7f0b.webp)\n\nIn fact, a lot of page loads just timed out with errors.\n\n## Fortunately, it seems I have managed to clear up the problems!\n\nI have put a bunch of mitigations in place, and after monitoring the situation for the past hour, it seems that **our performance issues have been resolved for now.** So hopefully, you can enjoy browsing lemm.ee again without it feeling like torture!\n\nHere are specific steps I took:\n\n* I have **doubled the hardware resources for our backend servers and database**. \n* I purchased a Cloudflare pro subscription for lemm.ee for 1 year. This took out a considerable chunk of my budget for lemm.ee, but in return it will allow me to analyze and optimize our cache usage to a far greater extent. I am already seeing vastly reduced load times for cacheable content (try opening https://lemm.ee a few times in a row as a logged out user - it should be blazing fast now!)\n* I have configured a rate limiter which will prevent future DoS from the specific method that was used against us today.\n\n\nOf course, all of the above is costly.  Luckily, lemm.ee users have been very generous with donations in the month of June, and in fact a significant amount of donors have opted for monthly recurring contributions. This all gives me the confidence to increase our spending for now, and I am currently expecting to NOT increase my personal planned contribution of 150‚Ç¨/month, **as the increased costs so far are entirely being covered by donations**! \n\n#### Let me take this opportunity to thank the sponsors who made the upgrades possible! All lemm.ee users are now enjoying better performance thanks to you, I could not have done it without you awesome people.\n\nOn a final note, I just want to say that I hope a lot of these issues can be solved by optimizations in Lemmy software itself in the future. I have been personally contributing several optimizations to the Lemmy codebase, and I know many others are focused on optimizations as well. Just throwing extra resources at the problem will probably not be a sustainable solution for very long üòÖ.

There are a bunch of good samaritans who have built massive houses (instances like kbin.social, mastodon.social, Lemmy.world, peertube etc.) that can host tons of people and also give you the construction plan for the houses, so you can choose to make your own kbin.bustanutella if you want to. Just because you're in a different house than your friends doesn't mean you can't communicate or interact with them. You don't even need to be a member of the same house to interact with them or any posts from their home. All that needs to happen is that both your house and your friends house need to agree to open their windows to each other, which is pretty standard as instances usually federate with each other freely unless an instance does something bad (spam, violating ToS, etc.)\n\nSo now, when your friend takes a shit on the floor of his house (makes a post), you get to see it and interact with it from the comfort of your own home.

Years ago, I built something similar, and back then I drew a lot of inspiration from Postmill. This time, to avoid starting from scratch, I get some elements from my old snippets. Originally, kbin was meant to be a project just for me and a few friends, so I didn't attribute the origin authors. That's not an excuse, though ‚Äî I should have done it right away when the project became public on git. I have a point in my roadmap called \"Preparing a repository for contributors,\" where I allocated a significant amount of time to educate myself about licenses, attributions, and so on. Unfortunately, everything unfolded in the wrong order.\n\n[https://codeberg.org/Kbin/kbin-core/issues/196](https://codeberg.org/Kbin/kbin-core/issues/196)\n\nI think Emma is right. Since I share my small successes with you, I also want to be transparent about my failures and mistakes. I will push the proper attributions to the repository today along with some critical fixes.\n\nTo avoid reinventing the wheel, I took some code used in federation from Pixelfed as well. Essentially, there are two projects two projects will be marked.

It's obvious that someone will take a look at the code of a project that is very similar to theirs. Sometimes, I just become terribly messy when I have to do many things at once. This lesson will definitely teach me to prioritize tasks better.\n\nIn the end, I can only promise that once everything settles down and I manage to extract a library for ActivityPub, I will revisit the Postmill repository, this time with a pull request proposal.\n\nYou should definitely check it out.\n\n[https://postmill.xyz/](https://postmill.xyz/) - Project page  \n[https://raddle.me/](https://raddle.me/) - Postmill instance  \n[https://pixelfed.org/](https://pixelfed.org/) - Of course, everyone here is familiar with this one ;)\n\nPS. the website should be running a bit faster.

Nicht wirtschaftlich, aber was das Verst√§ndnis von Zukunft und Leben angeht. Daf√ºr muss man noch nicht einmal die Offensichtlichkeit des Klimadebakels erw√§hnen, das die Generation de Maizi√®re seit Jahrzehnten halbherzig bis ignorierend beobachtet, als sei sie unbeteiligt.\n\nGanz vorne bei den Sch√§den ist die Deformation des Verh√§ltnisses zur Arbeit. De Maizi√®res Generation hat keinen Zweifel daran gelassen, dass die 40-Stunden-Woche heilig ist. Etwa indem ihre Mitglieder bis heute daf√ºr sorgen, dass Menschen mit Halbtagsjobs ihre Aufstiegschancen im Klosett heruntersp√ºlen k√∂nnen. Seine Generation hat f√ºr eine Arbeitswelt gesorgt, in der Burn-out zur Volkskrankheit geworden ist. Seine Generation hat daf√ºr gesorgt, dass Vereinbarkeit von Familie und Beruf pendelt zwischen Hohn, toxischem Patriarchat und der Frage, ob und wie viele Gro√üeltern mithelfen k√∂nnen. Seine Alterskohorte hat durch langj√§hrige Ver√§chtlichkeit und Abwehr der digitalen Welt gegen√ºber daf√ºr gesorgt, dass es eine Pandemie mit 100.000 Toten brauchte, bis man in Deutschland die Segnungen des Homeoffices zu sch√§tzen wusste.\n\nVor allem aber hat de Maizi√®res Generation klassische Lohnarbeit als praktisch einzige gesellschaftlich anerkannte Selbstverwirklichungsoption inszeniert. Sogar T√§tigkeiten, auf die man irgendwie Bock hat oder die man sinnvoll findet, werden mit dem Begriff ¬ªEhrenamt¬´ zur Arbeit umoperiert, w√§hrend √ºberhaupt erst die Millennials auf die Idee kamen, fl√§chendeckend die extrem relevante Care-Arbeit √ºberhaupt als Arbeit zu identifizieren und entsprechend zu benennen.\n\nDementsprechend hat die Generation de Maizi√®re eine superproblematische Definition von Karriere gleich mitgeliefert: Festanstellung, Vollzeit, 45 Jahre Arbeit bis zur Rente, Eckb√ºro, Dienstkombi (silber wg. Wiederverkaufswert), Vizeabteilungsleitung, jeden zweiten Dienstag im M√§rz die Tochter mit ins B√ºro bringen, damit die Kinder mal sehen, wie und wo die Eltern das Bruttoinlandsprodukt zusammenkl√∂ppeln und vor Ehrfurcht erstarren.\n\n[...]\n\nDe Maizi√®res Generation ist deshalb oft so giftig gegen√ºber den ¬ªjungen Leuten¬´, weil sie ahnt, dass die richtig liegen k√∂nnten. Und die √Ñlteren deshalb Jahrzehnte ihrer kostbaren Lebenszeit verloren haben mit bekloppten Excelschlachten und der Umrechnung von Kalenderwochen in menschenw√ºrdige Zeitbeschreibungen.\n\nEs ist ein bekanntes psychologisches Ph√§nomen, dass die √úberbringenden einer Botschaft besonders dann angefeindet werden, wenn sie die eigenen, unwiederbringlichen Vers√§umnisse deutlich machen. Die Generation Z mit ihrer gesunden Abkehr von der als ¬ªKarriere¬´ getarnten Aufgabe des Privatlebens trifft den wunden Punkt von de Maizi√®res Generation Tastenton: n√§mlich die M√∂glichkeit, dass eventuell am Ende die goldene Uhr von der Firma samt des jahrzehntelangen Weges dorthin doch weniger gl√ºcklich gemacht hat, als viel Zeit mit der Familie oder mit Freunden, gezieltes Rumliegen, wenn man das braucht, sowie viel Erleben und Reisen ‚Äì selbst wenn man es w√§hrenddessen auf Instagram ver√∂ffentlicht.","creator_id":34343,"community_id":13045,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-14T16:44:16.945070","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"embed_title":"Sascha Lobo antwortet auf Thomas de Maizi√®re, der √ºber die Generation Z l√§stert","embed_description":"Die Anspruchshaltung der Generation Z gehe ihm gegen den Strich, sagt der ehemalige Innenminister Thomas de Maizi√®re.

Our goal is to have a place where people can freely and respectfully express their ideas/opinions without fear of being censored because they decided to use the wrong terms/wordings.\n\nWe will also not immediately suspend a user for their first infraction, though we will definitely warn them and won't be afraid to take action of it continues.\n\n# What Burggit is not\n#### **We are not another Kiwifarms, Gab or Voat!**\n\nWhile we're fine with people posting offensive speech and imagery, we won't allow them to use their right to \"Free Speech\" as a weapon against the overall health of the platform. Threatening, Berating, Dogpiling, Doxxing and otherwise being complete and total assholes to other users will not be tolerated. \n\nHaving a different, unpopular opinion on a sensitive topic is fine, but there's absolutely no reason why anyone would not be able to express those opinions respectfully. And if you can't express those opinions without being shitty to other users directly, that's not something we're going to be putting up with.\n\nIf we believe that a user of ours is causing problems for our instance or other instances, we will not hesitate to deal with them.\n\n##### But what does it mean to be shitty?\nFor clarification I'll add some examples of behavior which would be deemed not okay.\n\nPlease note, this is not an exhaustive list.\n\n- Calling out death to a group or individual\n- Targeting another individual/user regardless of reason \n(Discussing something in a way which could be percieved as rude doesn't count, some people argue passionately and that's okay.)\n- Going out of your way to cause trouble with other friendly instances\n- Attacking someone's character, motive, or some other attribute of the person making an argument rather than addressing the substance of the argument itself.

Most are staying private, but some aren‚Äôt. As if Reddit doesn‚Äôt exist solely because of its user generated content. If enough subs permanently shut down, they‚Äôll be forced to reconsider their API position. Social media can't run without social media.\n\nI decided to write a message to subreddits I‚Äôve been lurking for years via messaging the mods saying how vitally important it is for subreddits to protest **right now**, at this **critical** time, before it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôve politely implored them to continue the protest saying how these API changes with have a long-lasting, permanent impact on Reddit as a platform for the worse.\n\nI‚Äôd suggest you guys come up with your own letter template and message the mods of those subreddits in polite form. It‚Äôd be great if we can convince these exceptions to go private again. I also understand some moderators may be afraid Reddit will just replace them with mods willing to reopen the sub, so I added a section saying it they‚Äôre treated like that, Reddit don‚Äôt deserve their time and maybe they should consider spending their time elsewhere if that happens. This is their prime chance to stand up for the right thing right now for the future of Reddit.\n\nI used [Reddark](https://reddark.untone.uk/) to determine which subreddits to contact. I‚Äôd say only contact hobbyist ones such as sports rather than more politically-inclined ones like Ukraine that have a fair reason to stay open. Also some subreddits have made poll posts asking their users if they should go private like Gaming and NotTheOnion, so please don‚Äôt message those ones.","creator_id":113238,"community_id":5095,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-14T14:40:55","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"ap_id":"https://kbin.social/m/RedditMigration/t/16047","local":false,"language_id":0,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":5095,"name":"RedditMigration","title":"RedditMigration","description":"Tracking the lastest news and numbers about the #RedditMigration to open, Fediverse-based alternatives, including #Kbin and #Lemmy To see latest reeddit blackout info, see here: https://reddark.untone.uk/","removed":false,"published":"2023-06-11T16:49:31","updated":"2023-06-30T05:55:21","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"actor_id":"https://kbin.social/m/RedditMigration","local":false,"icon":"https://media.kbin.social/18/45/1845eef07ed4f2e4d008c1c4035cdd40c812cd8d3b4aa7dd1c13f9f82e5722df.png","hidden":false,"posting_restricted_to_mods":false,"instance_id":221},"counts":{"id":506922,"comment_id":564180,"score":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"published":"2023-06-14T19:46:21","child_count":0,"hot_rank":1728},"creator_banned_from_community":false,"subscribed":"NotSubscribed","saved":false,"creator_blocked":false},{"comment":{"id":547532,"creator_id":84933,"post_id":83399,"content":"> Honestly I agree, growth is growth.\n\n( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)","removed":false,"published":"2023-06-12T01:29:29.710658","deleted":false,"ap_id":"https://lemmynsfw.com/comment/4406","local":false,"path":"0.259357.259358.259359.547532","distinguished":false,"language_id":0},"creator":{"id":84933,"name":"wackster_fapster","banned":false,"published":"2023-06-12T00:46:37.330093","actor_id":"https://lemmynsfw.com/u/wackster_fapster","local":false,"deleted":false,"admin":false,"bot_account":false,"instance_id":4298},"post":{"id":83399,"name":"What other Coms (communities) would you like to see in LemmyNSFW?","body":"Yes im making slang, communities is such a long word. \n\nIm interested what kind of things we should (eventually, anyway) cover.","creator_id":50944,"community_id":3401,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-11T15:31:49.137961","updated":"2023-06-15T15:18:10.966939","deleted":false,"nsfw":true,"ap_id":"https://lemmynsfw.com/post/510","local":false,"language_id":0,"featured_community":true,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":3401,"name":"asklemmynsfw","title":"Ask Lemmy NSFW","removed":false,"published":"2023-06-11T11:09:47.874345","deleted":false,"nsfw":true,"actor_id":"https://lemmynsfw.com/c/asklemmynsfw","local":false,"hidden":false,"posting_restricted_to_mods":false,"instance_id":4298},"counts":{"id":491803,"comment_id":547532,"score":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"published":"2023-06-12T01:29:29.710658","child_count":0,"hot_rank":1728},"creator_banned_from_community":false,"subscribed":"NotSubscribed","saved":false,"creator_blocked":false},{"comment":{"id":551690,"creator_id":503112,"post_id":578098,"content":"While a decentralized ecosystem has its owns problems and challenges , I hope the whole Lemmy thing gets traction. \n\nI‚Äôm happy to see Budgetkeebs exploring this kind of alternatives.

Years ago, I built something similar, and back then I drew a lot of inspiration from Postmill. This time, to avoid starting from scratch, I get some elements from my old snippets. Originally, kbin was meant to be a project just for me and a few friends, so I didn't attribute the origin authors. That's not an excuse, though ‚Äî I should have done it right away when the project became public on git. I have a point in my roadmap called \"Preparing a repository for contributors,\" where I allocated a significant amount of time to educate myself about licenses, attributions, and so on. Unfortunately, everything unfolded in the wrong order.\n\n[https://codeberg.org/Kbin/kbin-core/issues/196](https://codeberg.org/Kbin/kbin-core/issues/196)\n\nI think Emma is right. Since I share my small successes with you, I also want to be transparent about my failures and mistakes. I will push the proper attributions to the repository today along with some critical fixes.\n\nTo avoid reinventing the wheel, I took some code used in federation from Pixelfed as well. Essentially, there are two projects two projects will be marked. However, I have never concealed this fact:\n\n[https://kbin.social/m/random/p/254858/The-real-reason-why-I-haven-t-published-the-pixelfed-app#post-comment-438684](https://kbin.social/m/random/p/254858/The-real-reason-why-I-haven-t-published-the-pixelfed-app#post-comment-438684)\n\nI mean that I'm not a guy who wants to steal your code. It's obvious that someone will take a look at the code of a project that is very similar to theirs. Sometimes, I just become terribly messy when I have to do many things at once. This lesson will definitely teach me to prioritize tasks better.\n\nIn the end, I can only promise that once everything settles down and I manage to extract a library for ActivityPub, I will revisit the Postmill repository, this time with a pull request proposal.\n\nYou should definitely check it out.\n\n[https://postmill.xyz/](https://postmill.xyz/) - Project page  \n[https://raddle.me/](https://raddle.me/) - Postmill instance  \n[https://pixelfed.org/](https://pixelfed.org/) - Of course, everyone here is familiar with this one ;)\n\nPS. the website should be running a bit faster.

Refugees are welcome here.\n\nThe goal for lemm.ee is to provide a home Lemmy instance for anybody that needs one. That means that you are more than welcome here even if you mostly intend to just interact with other instances rather than this one!\n\n*Note: if you want to start up a new community here, but the name is already taken by an inactive community, then don't worry! Inactive communities can be transferred to new moderators. Please follow the steps outlined in [our FAQ](https://lemm.ee/post/37715) under the \"How can I take over an inactive community\" section.*\n\n### What is Lemmy?\n\nLemmy is a federated link aggregator. [This image explains it pretty well!](https://i.imgur.com/b2QuYAR.png) In general, the fact that it's \"federated\" just means that it works much like e-mail - in the same way as a Gmail user can send e-mails to iCloud Mail users or Outlook users, a lemm.ee user is able to participate in communities on many different Lemmy instances. Regardless of which Lemmy instance your account lives on, you are a part of the federated network and can interact with other users from other instances, so this instance is as good of a place as any other to get started with Lemmy.\n\nIf you have any further questions about Lemmy, please check out [our guide/FAQ](https://lemm.ee/post/37715)!\n\n### About lemm.ee (this instance)\n\n**lemm.ee is intended to be a serious long-term instance, not just some random experiment.**\n\nYou can always find the most up to date rules and general info about lemm.ee in the sidebar on our front page. If you want to know more about how this instance is run, you can check our [administration and federation policy](https://lemm.ee/post/401063).\n\n---------\n\nFor some technical background, this instance is operated following industry best practices:\n\n* Our infrastructure is robust and has been built up with redundancy and recoverability in mind\n* The servers are running in the cloud (this is not some bedroom server situation!)\n* All of the infrastructure is described declaratively as code, which allows relatively quick and safe changes to any part of our infrastructure whenever necessary\n* Our entire database is backed up constantly, so in the worst case, we can always restore our data\n\n\n---------\n\n**A significant chunk of funding for this infrastructure comes directly from our amazing community. This support is essential to help secure our future. These supporters deserve the gratitude of all lemm.ee users!** \n\nYou can read more details about how our instance is funded on this [GitHub sponsorships page](http://github.com/sponsors/sunaurus). There is also a [Ko-Fi donations page](https://ko-fi.com/sunaurus) as a back-up.\n\n---------\n\n#### If it sounds like lemm.ee might be the right instance for you, then you are welcome to join us!","creator_id":32347,"community_id":1944,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-09T09:21:41.427419","updated":"2023-06-27T10:48:24.975549","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"ap_id":"https://lemm.ee/post/26","local":false,"language_id":37,"featured_community":true,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":1944,"name":"meta","title":"Meta (lemm.ee)","description":"## lemm.ee Meta\n\nThis is a community for discussion about this particular Lemmy instance.\n\nNews and updates about lemm.ee will be posted here, so if that's something that interests you, make sure to subscribe!\n\nIf you need help with anything, please post in [!support](https://lemm.ee/c/support) instead.\n","removed":false,"published":"2023-06-09T08:52:25.824301","updated":"2023-06-16T15:37:32.228777","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"actor_id":"https://lemm.ee/c/meta","local":false,"icon":"https://lemm.ee/pictrs/image/63bb47f1-1446-486a-9a1e-2246580ecdb3.png","hidden":false,"posting_restricted_to_mods":false,"instance_id":4159},"counts":{"id":497197,"comment_id":553420,"score":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"published":"2023-06-10T02:05:09.969175","child_count":1,"hot_rank":1728},"creator_banned_from_community":false,"subscribed":"NotSubscribed","saved":false,"creator_blocked":false},{"comment":{"id":540143,"creator_id":58487,"post_id":36342,"content":"Tankies are much closer to any capitalist and right winger then they are to leftists.

On 13th June the Sub had 2.4% of the total comments and 0.44% of the total site posts. \nSadly I can't see the list of the most commenting and posting subs from reddit before the Blackout because it doesn't seem to work on wayback machine.\n\nBut currently it seems like the Top100 commenting Subreddits only make out ~10% (Askreddit: ~1.5%) . So the bulk of the comments happens on the sheer number of other active subreddits.\n\nThe subreddit stats site also doesn't show how it gets the data and doesn't make it easy to see historical data overview.

Zoek een community**\n\nGa naar https://browse.feddit.de/ en zoek een community op basis van sleutelwoorden, bijvoorbeeld *android*:\n\n![](https://feddit.nl/pictrs/image/be19fb8a-990d-45da-a83c-78e51c20a28c.png)\n\nKlik op het kopieer-icoontje om de link naar je klembord te kopi√´ren.\n\n**2. Federeer de community**\n\nKlik op de link **Communities** bovenaan feddit.nl en plak de link in het zoekveld. Klik op **Search**. Er zal nu niets worden gevonden, maar je kunt in de dropdown van **Type** vervolgens de waarde **All** kiezen. Doe dit en zoek opnieuw. Nu zal de community verschijnen:\n\n![](https://feddit.nl/pictrs/image/0e66396d-4ec3-4a71-8a7f-13b299daaf42.png)\n\n**3. Abonneren**\n\nKlik op de link om de community te openen. Je kunt je nu abonneren en voor andere gebruikers van feddit.nl zal de externe community nu ook beschikbaar zijn in de lijst met communities.","creator_id":16338,"community_id":5749,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-06T20:47:39.566595","updated":"2023-06-07T05:09:20.417175","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"ap_id":"https://feddit.nl/post/1610","local":false,"language_id":115,"featured_community":true,"featured_local":false},"community":{"id":5749,"name":"feddit_nl","title":"feddit.nl updates","removed":false,"published":"2023-06-04T22:04:24.743254","updated":"2023-06-29T05:50:27.089123","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"actor_id":"https://feddit.nl/c/feddit_nl","local":false,"icon":"https://feddit.nl/pictrs/image/f80d8d5b-8feb-4777-8234-cef3f2e76cd7.webp","hidden":false,"posting_restricted_to_mods":false,"instance_id":3935},"counts":{"id":489196,"comment_id":544451,"score":1,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":0,"published":"2023-06-08T09:13:40.146215","child_count":0,"hot_rank":1728},"creator_banned_from_community":false,"subscribed":"NotSubscribed","saved":false,"creator_blocked":false}]}
