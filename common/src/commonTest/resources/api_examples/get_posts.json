We all know that when it comes to network issues, the struggle is real, and sometimes you just have to laugh to keep from crying.\nWhether it's a major outage during an important exam, a bizarre series of events leading to chaos, or an \"unplanned downtime\" that left everyone scratching their heads, I'm sure we all have tales to tell. Let's take a moment to bond over our shared experiences and maybe even find some comfort in knowing we're not alone.\nHere are a few questions to get the ball rolling:\n    1. What was the most outrageous network outage you've ever encountered in an educational setting?\n    2. How did the network outage impact students, teachers, and staff? Any funny or memorable reactions?\n    3. Did you uncover any unexpected causes or discover some unbelievable solutions?\n    4. How did you handle the pressure and keep your cool during these incidents?\n    5. Looking back, what lessons did you learn from these network outages?\n\nLooking forward to reading your stories and finding some humor in the chaos! Let's turn these network outages into tales worth telling\n","creator_id":631825,"community_id":91982,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-20T17:26:37.326318","updated":null,"deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"embed_title":null,"embed_description":null,"embed_video_url":null,"thumbnail_url":null,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.ml/post/1393593","local":true,"language_id":37,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"creator":{"id":631825,"name":"micballin","display_name":null,"avatar":"https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/a2cf608f-c1e6-433a-93bf-f976f2641916.jpeg","banned":false,"published":"2023-06-02T20:43:50.218539","updated":null,"actor_id":"https://lemmy.ml/u/micballin","bio":null,"local":true,"banner":null,"deleted":false,"inbox_url":"https://lemmy.ml/u/micballin/inbox","shared_inbox_url":"https://lemmy.ml/inbox","matrix_user_id":null,"admin":false,"bot_account":false,"ban_expires":null,"instance_id":394},"community":{"id":91982,"name":"k12sysadmin","title":"k12sysadmin","description":"This is meant to be a public education focused IT support community.","removed":false,"published":"2023-06-14T14:11:31.566689","updated":"2023-06-14T14:12:41.948049","deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"actor_id":"https://lemmy.ml/c/k12sysadmin","local":true,"icon":null,"banner":null,"hidden":false,"posting_restricted_to_mods":false,"instance_id":394},"creator_banned_from_community":false,"counts":{"id":215757,"post_id":1393593,"comments":0,"score":0,"upvotes":1,"downvotes":1,"published":"2023-06-20T17:26:37.326318","newest_comment_time_necro":"2023-06-20T17:26:37.326318","newest_comment_time":"2023-06-20T17:26:37.326318","featured_community":false,"featured_local":false,"hot_rank":1728,"hot_rank_active":1728},"subscribed":"NotSubscribed","saved":false,"read":false,"creator_blocked":false,"my_vote":null,"unread_comments":0},{"post":{"id":1393355,"name":"ChatGPT Cheat Sheet V2","url":null,"body":"cross-posted from:  https://lemmy.world/post/347903\n\n> ![](https://lemmy.world/pictrs/image/90f0bb58-b7fa-4153-9a58-037151882dca.png)","creator_id":683963,"community_id":16,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-20T17:09:33.089806","updated":null,"deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"embed_title":null,"embed_description":null,"embed_video_url":null,"thumbnail_url":null,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.world/post/347984","local":false,"language_id":0,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"creator":{"id":683963,"name":"Blaed","display_name":null,"avatar":null,"banned":false,"published":"2023-06-10T16:16:11.325305","updated":null,"actor_id":"https://lemmy.world/u/Blaed","bio":null,"local":false,"banner":null,"deleted":false,"inbox_url":"https://lemmy.world/u/Blaed/inbox","shared_inbox_url":"https://lemmy.world/inbox","matrix_user_id":null,"admin":false,"bot_account":false,"ban_expires":null,"instance_id":136816},"community":{"id":16,"name":"technology","title":"Technology","description":"This is the official technology community of Lemmy.ml for all news related to creation and use of technology, and to facilitate civil, meaningful discussion around it.\n\n---\n\nRules:\n\n1: All Lemmy rules apply\n\n2: Do not post low effort posts\n\n3: NEVER post naziped*gore stuff\n\n4: Always post article URLs or their archived version URLs as sources, NOT screenshots.

There are many more fancy readers on desktop.\n\nAlso Feeder on mobile is pretty good, it's available on F-Droid.\n\nWith that and moving to lemmy you might break free of your reddit addiction and not fall into the trap of using the crappy official app just to watch dank memes.\n\nAlso forget about Karma. I have over 200K karma on Reddit that is utterly useless. Touching grass is more pleasing than getting karma.  You can read something on reddit from your RSS feed while touching grass too, multitasking. \n","creator_id":13930,"community_id":14762,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-20T16:55:11.928752","updated":null,"deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"embed_title":null,"embed_description":null,"embed_video_url":null,"thumbnail_url":null,"ap_id":"https://lemmy.ml/post/1392515","local":true,"language_id":0,"featured_community":false,"featured_local":false},"creator":{"id":13930,"name":"vis4valentine","display_name":null,"avatar":"https://lemmy.ml/pictrs/image/eSw7w7hCNS.jpg","banned":false,"published":"2020-08-24T19:57:06.100471","updated":"2022-08-03T20:49:27.417568","actor_id":"https://lemmy.ml/u/vis4valentine","bio":null,"local":true,"banner":null,"deleted":false,"inbox_url":"https://lemmy.ml/u/vis4valentine/inbox","shared_inbox_url":"https://lemmy.ml/inbox","matrix_user_id":"@vis4valentine:matrix.nogafam.es","admin":false,"bot_account":false,"ban_expires":null,"instance_id":394},"community":{"id":14762,"name":"reddit","title":"Reddit","description":null,"removed":false,"published":"2019-08-23T09:57:07.693899","updated":null,"deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"actor_id":"https://lemmy.ml/c/reddit","local":true,"icon":null,"banner":null,"hidden":false,"posting_restricted_to_mods":false,"instance_id":394},"creator_banned_from_community":false,"counts":{"id":215613,"post_id":1392515,"comments":7,"score":22,"upvotes":24,"downvotes":2,"published":"2023-06-20T16:55:11.928752","newest_comment_time_necro":"2023-06-20T18:32:27.206362","newest_comment_time":"2023-06-20T18:32:27.206362","featured_community":false,"featured_local":false,"hot_rank":1728,"hot_rank_active":1728},"subscribed":"NotSubscribed","saved":false,"read":false,"creator_blocked":false,"my_vote":null,"unread_comments":7},{"post":{"id":1392527,"name":"[Bug]: Lemmy is aking for a application/ld+json webfinger where it should be jrd+json or xrd+xml · Issue #3222 · LemmyNet/lemmy (Lemmy can't federate with Pleroma / Akkoma)","url":"https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/3222","body":null,"creator_id":630888,"community_id":96230,"removed":false,"locked":false,"published":"2023-06-20T16:57:09.341868","updated":null,"deleted":false,"nsfw":false,"embed_title":"[Bug]: Lemmy is aking for a application/ld+json webfinger where it should be jrd+json or xrd+xml · Issue #3222 · LemmyNet/lemmy","embed_description":"Requirements Is this a bug report?

These are easily upvoted, but they pollute the subreddit very quickly.

Things like urban planning, mobility & transportation, social equity, Dutch culture, etc..\n 4. **No trolling** Go troll somewhere else. We don't need that shit here.\n 5. **No comment screenshots** We have no patience for advocates of vehicular cycling.

You can post that crap somewhere else.\n 6. **No people being hit by cars / road violence** Do not show videos or pictures of people being hit by cars, or other road violence. We don't need to see that shit. We know cars are dangerous, and many people have bad memories of car crashes. Keep it out of this subreddit.\n 7. **No tone policing** We don't need any more tone police. If you don't like the tone that Not Just Bike takes in his videos, there's a very easy solution: stop watching them.\n 8. **No Internet drama** Don't spread or promote drama over what has happened on the Internet.
